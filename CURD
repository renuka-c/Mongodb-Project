CURD OPERATIONS :

                 CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations that can be performed on data in a database or     
                        storage system.

 							  email : "renuka@gmail.com"
                                                         }

Read Operations :

                                        {productNmae : "Laptop"},
                                         { $set : {price : 12000}
                                        )
