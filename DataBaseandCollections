DataBase :
     A database in Mongodb is stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A 
       database stores one or more collections of documents
                       
     A MongoDB server can host multiple databases, each with its own set of collections and documents.To select a database to use, in 
       mongosh, issue the use <db> statement, as in the following 

                                  Syntax:   use DATABASE_NAME
                                  Example :  use myDemodatabase
 
                If we want to get list of all databases.

                                  Syntax : show dbs

                If we want to know current selected database.
  		 
                                  Syntax : db
 

                To drop/delete the database , this will drop the selected database.

                                  Syntax : db.dropDatabase()

 
Collections :
        A collection is a grouping of MongoDB documents. Documents within a collection can have different fields.
      
             Example :
                     			  {
         		 			 name : "renuka",
			  			 age : 23,
			 		         email : "renuka.1@gmail.com"
					}
			
							Collection


                 To create Collection .

                                Syntax : db.createCollection(name)
                                Example : db.createCollection("Employee");

                 To check Collection list.

                                Syntax : show collectins

                 To drop/delete selected collection.
         
                                 Syntax : db.COLLECTION_NAME.drop()
                 
                 To rename yor collection :
          
                                  Syntax : db.<ciiectn>.renameCollection('collection')
